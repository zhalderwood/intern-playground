# Intern Playground
A repo for code written via tutorials for my summer 2021 internship.

## CityInfo
This is a Visual Studio project where I've created a database and a custom API using ASP.NET with help of a PluralSight tutorial. In this tutorial, I learned a ton about using .NET core to design and implement my own API which can accept GET, PUT, POST, PATCH, and DELETE requests. This application also verifies inputs and defines policies and relationships in observance of general best practices in database design concepts.
